I'll upgrade them in this sequence

1.uploading various independent/dependent functions for one board game
###
2.uploading one board game as a code as whole
###
3.add support for savestate and loadstate
###
4.overhaul code add graphical interface to game.
###
5.streamline code for better performance.

after i started writing code for the first game, i forgot to push to git and after a few days of working i ultimately abandoned the code, the initial code was written in C(not available now), i changed it to Java and tried to remake the whole game again(but i forgot all the rules i established for the game(i made a whole new board game) so the project was then wholly Abandoned, i might get back to it someday, if my schedules allow for leisure)
